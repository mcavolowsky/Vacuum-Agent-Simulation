'''Implement Agents and Environments (Chapters 1-2).

The class hierarchies are as follows:

Object ## A physical object that can exist in an environment
    Agent
        RandomReflexAgent
        ...
    Dirt
    Wall
        DeadCell
    Fire
    ...

Environment ## An environment holds objects, runs simulations
    XYEnvironment
        VacuumEnvironment

EnvFrame ## A graphical representation of the Environment

    Abstract class representing an Environment.  'Real' Environment classes inherit from this. Your Environment will
    typically need to implement:
        percept:           Define the percept that an agent sees.
        execute_action:    Define the effects of executing an action.
                           Also update the agent.performance slot.
    The environment keeps a list of .objects and .agents (which is a subset of .objects). Each agent has a .performance
    slot, initialized to 0.  Each object has a .location slot, even though some environments may not need this.
